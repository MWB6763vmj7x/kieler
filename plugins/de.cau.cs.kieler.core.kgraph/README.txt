\______________________________________

Graph data structure generated with EMF that is used to capture the structure
of a graphical model, e.g. to perform automatic layout on this structure.
This model allows arbitrary additional data to be attached to each graph
element, thus making it suitable for use in different contexts.

The model code generated by EMF is checked in and ready to use.
